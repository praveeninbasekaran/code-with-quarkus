Based on the complete set of user stories, screenshots, Figma flows, tables, and DB schemas you’ve shared, here is a comprehensive summary of the Dynamic Risk Monitoring – Process Risk Profile Module:

⸻

🧾 Page Name:

Overall Risk Profile (Landing Page)

⸻

🎯 Objective:

To enable users to monitor risk exposure per business process, assess control effectiveness, and drill into risk details or trigger further risk evaluations (e.g., Ad-hoc RCSA).

⸻

🗺️ Page Flow & Actions:

✅ 1. Landing Page: Overall Risk Profile
	•	View Type: Card view per process (e.g., Process One to Process Ten)
	•	Widgets per card:
	•	Total Risks
	•	Total Controls
	•	Inherent Risk donut chart
	•	Residual Risk donut chart
	•	Button: View Risk Details
➜ Navigates to “Process Level or Risk Level Profile”

⸻

✅ 2. Process Level or Risk Level Profile
	•	View Type: Tabbed – Profile View and Co-pilot RCSA

🔷 Tab: Profile View
	•	Table columns:
	•	Organisation
	•	Risk name & ID
	•	Inherent Risk
	•	Control Effectiveness (%)
	•	Residual Risk
	•	Last Approved Date (Residual)
	•	Calculated Residual Risk at the time
	•	#Controls
	•	CE Factors (🔗 hyperlink → Tableau popup)
	•	RCSA (🔗 hyperlink → Ad-hoc RCSA popup)
	•	Cause L1
	•	Cause L2

🔸 Actions:
	•	Click “Details” (CE Factors):
	•	Opens popup showing Tableau embedded dashboard based on risk ID.
	•	Click “Ad-hoc RCSA”:
	•	Triggers popup → warns last performed date.
	•	“Continue” → shows dropdown to select Reason (Regulatory, Environment, etc.) and Comment box.
	•	“Proceed” → creates a new Ad-hoc alert record.

⸻

🔷 Tab: Co-pilot RCSA
	•	Purpose: Shows detailed drilldown of selected risk:
	•	Inherent Risk (rating + rationale + impact areas)
	•	Control Effectiveness (rating + CST/KCI pass/fail)
	•	Issues (open/closed, severity)
	•	Events (high/medium/low)
	•	Residual Risk (rating + rationale)

⸻

📥 Inbound Data Source (from UDL):

Data is pulled from UDL (Unified Data Layer) and populated into internal database tables.

🔽 UDL → Internal DB Tables:
	•	Risk details
	•	Risk ratings
	•	Control metadata
	•	Issue and event logs
	•	Residual/inherent metrics
	•	Historical approvals

⸻

📤 Outbound/Manually Created Data:

💡 Manually created or system-generated (not from UDL):
	•	Ad-hoc RCSA alerts (triggered by user)
	•	Comments and reasons selected for RCSA
	•	Potential user audit logs

⸻

📂 Tables Involved:

🔷 1. drm_sit_rcsa_process_management (Internal Master Table)
	•	Stores static process metadata
	•	Populated via UDL
	•	Fields include: process_id, name, description, owner, functions (L1–L3), legal entity, inputs, outputs, etc.

⸻

🔷 2. rcsa_process_profile_view (Derived/Joined View Table)
	•	One record per risk under a process
	•	Populated from UDL + enriched with RCSA and CE data
	•	Used in Profile View tab

⸻

🔷 3. rcsa_adhoc_alerts (New Table – Custom Data)
	•	Stores Ad-hoc RCSA alert triggers
	•	Created manually via UI
	•	Fields:
	•	id, process_id, risk_id
	•	reason, comments
	•	triggered_by
	•	created_at, status

⸻

🔷 4. (Optional) rcsa_ce_factor_log or CE Dashboard Source Table
	•	If CE factors need logging or lookup for Tableau display
	•	Can act as bridge table for Tableau embed context

⸻

📐 UX / Functional Logic Summary:

Action	Trigger	Result
Click View Risk Details	From landing page	Loads drilldown profile for selected process
Click Details	CE Factors cell	Opens Tableau CE dashboard popup
Click Ad-hoc RCSA	RCSA cell	Shows reason dropdown + comment → creates alert
Expand “Risk One/Two”	In Co-pilot tab	Shows detailed breakdown of risks



⸻

📝 Recommendations:
	•	Audit Trail: Add audit table to log user actions like RCSA trigger or CE drilldowns.
	•	Alert Workflow Table: If RCSA alerts need approvals, a status-tracking table (rcsa_alert_workflow) can be used.
	•	Process-Risk Mapping Table: Consider a normalized rcsa_process_risk_map(process_id, risk_id) for linking risks to processes.

⸻

Let me know if you’d like:
	•	DDL scripts for rcsa_adhoc_alerts or view queries
	•	API endpoint contracts (GET profile view, POST RCSA alert, etc.)
	•	Suggested data flow diagram or ER diagram

Ready to support next stage of build!
